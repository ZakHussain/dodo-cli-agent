    "description": "A black rectangular card or tile with a white diagonal line or arrow design on it, placed on a light-colored wooden floor with visible grain patterns. The floor appears to be laminate or hardwood with a natural beige/tan finish. Around the edges of the image are what appear to be parts of furniture legs or objects - dark colored cylindrical shapes visible in the corners and upper portion of the frame. There's also what looks like a purple or iridescent spherical object partially visible at the top of the image.",
