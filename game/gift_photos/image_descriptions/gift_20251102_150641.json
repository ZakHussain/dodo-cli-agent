    "description": "A scene showing toy figures or game pieces on a light wood-grain surface. Visible elements include: a green textured object (possibly a tree or bush) on the left side, black cylindrical pieces that appear to be legs or supports for figures, a red triangular or angular piece, and what appears to be parts of toy figures with black feet/boots. The surface has a distinctive light beige wood pattern with visible grain lines.",
