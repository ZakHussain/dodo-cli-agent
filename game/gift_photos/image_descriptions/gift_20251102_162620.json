    "description": "A turquoise or teal-colored spherical ball with a textured, dimpled surface similar to a golf ball. The object appears to be made of rubber or foam material with a mottled pattern showing darker and lighter shades of green-blue. The ball is positioned on a light-colored wooden floor with visible grain patterns. The image shows motion blur suggesting movement, and there are partial views of people's feet/legs and what appears to be furniture or objects in the background.",
