    "description": "The image shows a workspace or desk surface with a weathered gray wooden texture. There is an open cardboard box with a peachy-pink or salmon-colored interior visible on the right side. On the left side, there appear to be black chopsticks or similar utensils, and what looks like a pale yellow or cream-colored item (possibly food or another object). There are also what appear to be brown leather shoes or boots visible at the bottom of the image. A human hand is visible holding or manipulating one of the black utensils. The overall scene appears to be photographed from above, showing a tabletop arrangement.",
